# varmeta

The *varmeta* package provides a lightweight way to manage variables.

## Motivation

It's best to keep variable units, descriptions, and other metadata in one
place. When we use them, we want those variables to be hashable so we can
put them in dictionaries etc.

It gets even harder when we deal with variables with components, like x, y, 
and z components in 3D space. It's annoying to have to write boilerplate to
unpack the values and label each one to get them into tables.

Fortunately, *varmeta* makes all this easy.
